#Create a grades.py program that checks whether a grade is above or below 55.
# Start by creating a variable called grade and give it a value between 0-100.
# Write a if/else statement for the following:
# If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed.
# Else, print "You failed.
# After you run the code, change grade's value and rerun it. 
# Do this a few times to make sure it's working as intended.

import random

grade = random.randint(0, 100);

if grade >= 55:
    print('You passed.')
else: 
    print('You failed')
